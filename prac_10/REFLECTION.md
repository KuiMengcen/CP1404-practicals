...Over time, my estimates became more accurate. I learned to factor in time for debugging, research, and testing, which improved my planning for practicals

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

...I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller components and allocating time for each part. This not only improved my estimates but also helped me manage my workload more effectively.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

...I learned how others perceive my code, especially in terms of readability, maintainability, and structure. Their feedback highlighted areas I could improve, such as following coding conventions and optimizing logic.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

...Reviewing othersâ€™ code taught me to identify good practices and common mistakes. It also reinforced my understanding of coding principles and helped me see alternative approaches to solving problems.
