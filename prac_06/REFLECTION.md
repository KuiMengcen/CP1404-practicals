# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

...In reflecting on my experience with this topic, I have moved towards a more systematic approach to coding tasks, particularly planning and pseudo-coding before starting the actual coding. Initially, I would often start coding immediately, which sometimes led to reworking sections that had not been well thought out. Now, I take more time to understand the problem and outline my approach, which makes my coding work more efficient and reduces the need for drastic revisions at a later stage.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

...I need to further improve my time management skills, especially in terms of allocating specific time to review and refactor code. While I have gotten better at planning my coding process, I sometimes underestimate the amount of time it takes to debug and optimize code. Improving my ability to more accurately estimate task durations and setting aside dedicated time for code reviews could make my workflow more efficient and less stressful.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

...I have been diligent in utilizing resources outside of classroom material, such as online tutorials, forums, and peer discussions, which have greatly enhanced my understanding and application of programming concepts. Constantly seeking external sources of knowledge has provided me with different perspectives and solutions that have enriched my learning experience. I plan to continue this proactive approach to learning throughout the program.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

...I should reduce my tendency to work alone for long periods of time without seeking feedback. Initially, I was hesitant to seek help, preferring to solve problems on my own, which sometimes led to unnecessary delays. I realized that discussing difficult issues with peers or mentors not only clarifies doubts, but also exposes me to different approaches and shortcuts. I intend to make regular counseling a part of my daily study.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

...One suggestion for the Information Technology degree program is to work on more practical projects with industry and other disciplines. This exposure to real industry problems and working in diverse teams would provide valuable practical insights and better prepare us for the professional environment. It would also be beneficial to invite information technology professionals to give guest lectures to discuss current trends and future directions in technology.
